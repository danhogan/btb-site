# About

My name is Dan Hogan. Below The Benthic is some sort of slightly-more-unique moniker I use on the interwebs. I identify as a web/software developer, musician, sports-nerd, and a follower of Jesus. All opinions on this site are my own. You can also find me on Github, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Soundcloud, Flickr, and maybe other places where you search for me.
